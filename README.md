# SurfAce - CS50 Final Project

SurfAce is a versatile website designed for bookmarking web-links and visual verification through embedded website views. Users can create custom bookmark folders to organize their links efficiently. The unique feature of embedded frames allows users to simultaneously surf multiple websites within the same tab.

This project was run on WAMP local server, with the main entry point of the website being [surf.php](/SurfAce/public/surf.php). It utilizes a SQL database for storing data, and the database structure is defined in the included data file [project50.sql](/SurfAce/project50.sql).
